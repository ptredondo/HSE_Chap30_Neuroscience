Supplementary Codes and Data for Chapter 30

The .R file contains the codes used to implement all procedures discussed in Chapter 30 and produce all figures for the chapter.

The .RData file contains the epilepsy EEG data analyzed in the main case study of the chapter and some pre-loaded results with longer run time to minimize computations for readers that want to try the codes.

Details of the epilepsy EEG data (dimension of 50000 x 19, sampling rate is 100 Hz or 100 time points per second, total of 500 seconds worth of recordings with pre-determined seizure onset at the 350-th second):
Row - EEG recording at time t, t = 1, ..., 50000 
Column - 19 EEG channels
