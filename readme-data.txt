EPILEPSY EEG DATASET

DATA DESCRIPTION 

The data contains EEG recordings from 19 channels of a female patient suffering from a temporal lobe epileptic seizure episode who is monitored by a neurologist at the epilepsy center at the University of Michigan. The EEG was sampled at 100 Hz (100 observations per second) and lasted for 500 seconds (equivalent to a total of 50,000 time points). The seizure onset occurs after the 350-th second (t = 35000). The data is organized as a matrix of dimension 50000x19 where the columns represent the 19 channels and the rows are the EEG recordings at time t, t = 1, ..., 50000.
